In this video, the car races in the map CG-SPEEDWAY-1. In NDPS[1], the author also provide the video in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s1pGcYUavpjBirwwwJnngkizuLkkAcL3/view. By comparing the videos, we can find that when the symbolic policy learned by ESPL and the program policy in NDPS is controlling, the car runs smoothly. However, when the neural network policy is running, the car will shake irregularly.
